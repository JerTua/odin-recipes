        <ol>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add the pork chops and return to a boil. 
                Cook the pork chops at a boil for 5 minutes, remove, and set aside to cool. 
                Remove 1 cup of the broth from the pot and set aside for later use. 
                Once the chops are cooled to the touch, cut into bite-size pieces.</li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <li>Return the water to a boil; add the pork liver to the pot and cook at a boil until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. 
                Drain and discard the liquid. 
                Set the liver aside to cool; cut into bite-size pieces.</li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. 
                Stir the pork chops into the onion and garlic; cook and stir together for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. 
                Add the tomatoes and reserved broth; cover and cook for 10 minutes. 
                Stir the pork liver, garbanzo beans, raisins, and potatoes into the mixture; cover and simmer until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
